### Calculus III

**Course Description:** 
Vector-valued functions of several variables, partial derivatives, multiple integration.

**Course Objectives:**
At the completion of this course, students will be able to demonstrate ability with the Calculus in ℝ3
to:
• Perform vector operations and use them to solve applied problems.
• Generalized the idea of vectors to vector-valued functions (lines, planes and other surfaces).
• Analyze contour diagrams to determine behavior of function of several variables.
• Analyze space curves and common surfaces.
• Evaluate and interpret partial derivatives, directional derivatives, gradient, curl and divergence.
• Set up and evaluate multiple integrals and line integrals.
